# Old Redux Way

## Folder structure
![old-structure](../pics/old-structure.png)

The actions directory would hold all action types, and definitions, example of actions file seen below

![old-actions](../pics/old-actions.png)

The reducer directory would hold the reducer for your redux state, example of reducer file seen below

![old-reducer](../pics/old-reducer.png)

    NOTE: you'd have to import all your action types (ADD_TODO, REMOVE_TODO, etc...) in order to switch on the action type. Also, with legacy redux, you have keep state immutable (always copy old state, and create a new state)
