# New Redux Toolkit Way

With the introduction of redux toolkit, there are many changes...

## changes
1. folder structure

    ![new-structrue](../pics/new-structure.png)
2. reducer (e.g.: todoSlice.ts)

    ![new-reducer](../pics/new-reducer.png)

       NOTE: notice here we mutate the state object directly.

    ```javascript
    // ability to mutate state directly with the help of immerjs
    state.push({value, id, complete: false});
    ```
