# Old Redux vs Redux Toolkit (RTK)

## Old Redux

***PROS***
- separation of concers
- creating separate smaller chunks of code makes it easier to unit test
- setting up redux in this fashion also helps for searchability, and less prone for error, as all action types are predefined for the developer to utilize

***CONS***
- this structure is harder to introduce new features, due to the amount of files needed to be updated
- new developers could have trouble figuring out the redux workflow
- manual immutable state update


----

## Redux Toolkit

***PROS***
- the slice paradigm allows for reducer object creation
- the slice object encasulates the action types based on reducer object keys
- single file for reducer, actions, and types
    - reducers can be broken out into separate files as necessary
```javascript
// exporting the actions from the todoSlice
export const { init, add, toggle, remove } = todoSlice.actions;

// exporting the reducer from the todoSlice
export default todoSlice.reducer;
```
- no need to think about immutability, as RTK handles that behind the scenes

***CONS***
- small paradigm shift if you're used to the old redux ways (dark age...)
